# DQNMaze
## About
This work is to make a random maze and use DQN to give direct suggestion. 
I really recommand if you just want to use the maze part. 
## About DQN
The DQN algorithm is based on the aritcle "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning". However, it seems not works so well. I guess it blames to the parameters. Well, but at least, it works on a 7 * 7 maze. I would be appreciate if you can give me some advice if you can apply it on a larger maze like 81 * 61. Thank you!
